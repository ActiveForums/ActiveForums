Active Forums Module for the DNN Platform

What is the Active Forums Module?

The Active Forums Module installs an online discussion forum that is tightly integrated with the DotNetNuke CMS platform. Previously offered as a commercial module from Active Modules Inc. the codebase has been converted to an open source project after the acquisition of Active Modules by DNN Corp.

Requirements

* DNN Platform v7.x (aka DotNetNuke)

Getting Started

* Download and install the latest release of the module install package.
* Login as host and install the module via the extension management page.
* Add an instance of the module to a page in your site.

Module settings can be accessed by placing the page in edit mode and then clicking on the 'settings' button in the modules edit menu.  Active Forum settings will appear in their own tab.

When first added to a page, the forum module will create a set of sample forums.  Forum can be added, removed or changed using the "Control Panel" link visible to administrators.
