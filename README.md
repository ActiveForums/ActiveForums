What is the Active Forums Module?

Previously offered as a commercial module from Active Modules Inc. the codebase has been converted to an open source project after the acquisition of Active Modules by DNN Corp.

Getting Started

* Download and install the DNN Platform (D CMS v7.x (if you have not done so already).
* Download and install the latest release of the module install package.
* Login as host and install the module via the extension management page.
* Add an instance of the module to a page in your site.

Module settings can be accessed by placing the page in edit mode and then clicking on the 'settings' button in the modules edit menu.  Active Forum settings will appear in their own tab.
